Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi, 1st Marquis of Marconi FRSA (Italian: [ɡuʎˈʎɛlmo marˈkoːni]; 
25 April 1874 – 20 July 1937) was an Italian[1][2][3][4] inventor and electrical engineer, 
known for his creation of a practical radio wave-based wireless telegraph system.[5] 
This led to Marconi being credited as the inventor of radio,[6] and he shared the 1909 
Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun "in recognition of their contributions to 
the development of wireless telegraphy".[7][8][9]
